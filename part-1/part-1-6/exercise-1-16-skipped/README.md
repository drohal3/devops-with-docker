# EXERCISE 1.16: CLOUD DEPLOYMENT
Exercised skipped to avoid trouble with setting up accounts in third-party providers and providing possibly required payment information (i.e. fly.io).

I have deployed different applications in the past using different services.

Exercise is at the bottom of https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-6.
