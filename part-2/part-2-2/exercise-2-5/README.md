# EXERCISE 2.5
## Task
The project https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise is a barely working application. Go ahead and clone it for yourself. The project already includes docker-compose.yml so you can start it by running docker compose up.

Application should be accessible through http://localhost:3000. However it doesn't work well enough and I've added a load balancer for scaling. Your task is to scale the compute containers so that the button in the application turns green.

This exercise was created with Sasu MÃ¤kinen

Please return the used commands for this exercise.

## Solution
Project copied to this directory ([scaling-exercise](./scaling-exercise)).

From the project's root directory, project started with
```
docker-compose up --scale compute=2
```
...created two containers of compute

accessed through http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and the button turned green after pressing it and waiting for a while.
