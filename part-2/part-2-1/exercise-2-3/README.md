# MANDATORY EXERCISE 2.3
## Task
As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

In the previous part we created Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend of the example application. Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

Configure the backend and frontend from part 1 to work in Docker Compose.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

## Solution
frontend and backend apps copied from exercise-1-14

- solution is in docker-compose.yaml file.
- backed ENV variables moved from backend Dockerfile to docker-compose.yaml

In browser, Part 1 of the app worked as expected.
