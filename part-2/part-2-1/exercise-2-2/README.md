# EXERCISE 2.2
## Task
Read about how to add command to docker-compose.yml from the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#command).

The familiar image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service can be used to start a web service.

Create a docker-compose.yml and use it to start the service so that you can use it with your browser.

Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running docker compose up

## Solution
- used the same image as in exercise-1-8 and exercise-2.1
- used command to run `server` as in exercise-1-8
- mapped ports, solution in docker-compose.yaml file
