# EXERCISE 3.11: KUBERNETES
**Task:**

Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes terminology and draw a diagram describing what "parts" the Kubernetes contain and how those are related to each other.

You should draw a diagram of at least three host machines in a Kubernetes cluster. In the diagram assume that the cluster is running two applications. The applications can be anything you want. An example could be a video game server and a blog website.

You may take inspiration from the diagrams of part 2.

The applications may utilize other machines or APIs that are not part of the cluster. At least three of the machines should be utilized. Include "your own computer" in the diagram as the one sending instructions via kubectl to deploy an application. In addition, include a HTTP message coming from the internet to your Kubernetes cluster and how it may reach an application.

Make sure to label the diagram so that anyone else who has completed this exercise, and read the glossary, would understand it. The diagram should contain at least four of the following labels: Pod, Cluster, Container, Service and Volume.

[Glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true) and some [helpful diagrams](https://medium.com/@tsuyoshiushio/kubernetes-in-three-diagrams-6aba8432541c).

I prefer to use draw.io, but you can use whichever tool you want.

**Solution:**
> The exercise was done with my limited understanding of Kubernetes which I had at the time when completing the exercise, hence the solution might not be 100% correct. The aim was to familiarize myself with basic concepts and terms.

The diagram is presented in [diagram.png](./diagram.png) file.
